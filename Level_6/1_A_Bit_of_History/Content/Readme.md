Django started as a side project of an intern who was fed up of maintaining bulky php code at a newspaper company called lawrence, it was created back in 2005, when there was little to no web applications written in python.

The devs were involved in multiple projects at the same time, which made them move all the common components of all the projects together as a single entity, that way they didn't need to redo the same thing over and over again. These common components was how django was born, the project was later open sourced and here we are 15 years later.

> Django was named after the jazz guitarist Jean Reinhardt, Django was his nickname.

Django was built to build applications quickly, one of its core philosophy is "Don't Repeat Yourself" often abbreviated as DRY. read about the others [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/misc/design-philosophies/)

This marks the midpoint of this course, technically everything taught till now can be used to build web applications, but they wont be maintainable and it will be really hard to share reusable components between them.

From this point on we'll learn more on Django's Generic capabilities and how we can utilise them to create applications with ease.
