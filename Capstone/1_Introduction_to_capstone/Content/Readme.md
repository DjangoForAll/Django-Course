### Introduction

Until now we were building and enhancing our task management application, this was a great way to understand the basics of web development and implement the various concepts we learned along the way.  
However, to strengthen your skills as a web developer, to think like a web developer, you must practice building applications from scratch. When building applications from scratch, you are tasked with understanding the requirements, building data structures around those reqirements, structuring the requirements to store them in databases, building out the UX from various perspectives, and so on.  
Instead of building clones of popular applications, weâ€™ll be building a tool that was designed to solve a real-world problem. This project encapsulates the core idea behind projects like the coronasafe network that strives to bring technology to solve real-world problems, building such projects will boost your confidence and encourage you to build similar solutions that help others.  

### Introducing Arike
Arike is a Malayalam word that roughly translates to Alongside or Besides in English. The project caters to a system of specialized medical staff tending to patients under palliative care,  
Unlike most of us who need medical care rarely and visit hospitals when required, there are thousands of people who need constant or specialized medical care, keeping these folks in the hospital is not a viable idea and bogs down our hospital capacity also making their life more difficult, these patients fall under palliative care.  
In India, palliative care is provided by a specially trained team of nurses who visit the patients under their panchayat/municipality directly to relieve their suffering and give them and their families the best possible quality of life. At present, many states have their own palliative care systems in place.  
The treatment under palliative care is an extremely complex process and it's mostly paper bound which makes it inefficient and error bound, Our capstone project is to build a system that makes the process more efficient and automated. There are a lot more nuances to this project which we will get to step by step.
