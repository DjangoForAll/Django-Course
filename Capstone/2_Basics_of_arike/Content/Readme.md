Before building any project, you should understand the exact requirements and discuss the use cases that your solution is trying to solve. So before we go any further, let's understand what Arike is trying to solve and who will be using Arike.

Generally, there is a “Primary Health Center” (PHC) and a “Community Health Center”(CHC). Each of this resides in a ward which belongs to one of the many LSGs (Local Self-Government) in a district. In every PHC, there is a primary nurse whose job is to visit patients locality-wise every month, go through their case sheets, and provide them with the treatments they need. If a particular patient needs expert care, they are referred to a specialist nurse who comes from the CHC. Now there are a lot of disadvantages in the current system, and you would be surprised to see how much paperwork is involved in such critical matters of life.

The main users for Arike are:

- Primary Nurse:
  This user persona is responsible for maintaining all the health records for a particular patient under their PHC.

- Secondary Nurse:
  This user persona belongs only to a CHC and is the specialist nurse that provides special care for a patient when referred by a primary nurse.

- District Admin:
  This user persona has access to records under the user’s district. This user will be given full access to the data and should be able to create and delete Primary or Secondary nurses.
