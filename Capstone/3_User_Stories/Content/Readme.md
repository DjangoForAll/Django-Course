Weâ€™ll be following the [agile methodology](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management) to develop our application. User Stories in agile methodology refers to an informal and general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end-user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.

Before we jump onto the user stories in this system, here are the main entities you would be dealing with.

- Facility: It can be a PHC or CHC.
- Patient: In our system, a patient is an object whose data we are dealing with, and they never get to use the software. A patient belongs to a PHC and is only referred to a CHC.

## User Stories

### District Admin

This persona will have the most access in the system and has eyes everywhere. They will be in control of all the facilities(PHC or CHC) and their specialists in a given district.

Here is how they will interact with the system:

- Manage facilities, wards and LSGs:  
  Admin will maintain a list of facilities, wards and LSGs and all their relevant data. Remember every LSG has a PHC and every 2 or more LSGs have a CHC. Every patient belongs to a ward and a ward belongs to an LSG. Filtering and sorting should also be doable. Only facilities can be soft-deleted.
- Registering and managing nurses:  
  Since this system has to be secure and allow only verified nurses to access the critical health records of patients, the admin will be responsible for filling out forms with the details of the nurses to be onboarded. An onboarding email will be sent to the respective nurses. Filtering and sorting the nurses should also be doable. Nurse records should have a soft-delete option.
- Assign nurses to facilities:  
  Only the admin has the power to assign nurses (primary or secondary) to each facility. This can be done while registering.

  > Every nurse must be associated with a facility.

  When a primary or secondary nurse logins to the system for the first time, they will be required to set a password for themselves and should only be able to login with an email that the admin entered while registering their profile on the system.

### Primary Nurse

This user persona is responsible for maintaining all the health records for a particular patient under their PHC.

Here is how they will interact with the system:

- Manage list of patients:  
  Filtering and sorting the patients should be doable.
- CRUD operations on patient object:  
  A nurse can create a patient object with their personal details and update the below categories during the first visit. Provision for sending an email with the treatment summary report consisting of all the data collected about the patient should be done. Patient records should have a soft-delete option.
  A patient object has 4 major categories:

  - Personal Details
  - Family Details
  - Health Information
  - Treatment history

- Visit the patient:  
  During the first visit to a patient, the patient object is updated and details for all the above categories are filed. On consecutive visits, a treatment report form is filled which alters the data in the last 2 categories stated above. The treatment report form should have the provision to refer the patient to any secondary nurse in the district especially based on their skillset (treatments they specialise in).

  Brownie Points: Filter the secondary nurses in the CHC to which the PHC of the primary nurse belongs to.

- Schedule a visit:  
  A nurse has to deal with a lot in a day. To make their lives easier, we want to enable them with a feature that allows them to prioritise their visits to critical patients on a daily basis.
  They should have a daily agenda view like in any digital calendar which they can reschedule and cross off their visits as they go about their day.

### Secondary Nurse

This user persona belongs only to a CHC and is the specialist nurse that provides special care for a patient only when referred by a primary nurse.
They have equal access to all data and interact with the system exactly like a primary nurse.

The only difference is that they deal with patients being referred to them and the treatment report form will have a different set of questions. They can see all data including all the patient objects under a PHC belonging to their CHC.

### Common Features

- All users will have the option to change their passwords.
- Nurses can update their personal information by requesting the district admin. ( For Brownie Points )

### Background Jobs

- Daily Report  
  Nurses will be sent an email every day at a configurable time with the daily report of their work, number of patients handled, treatments they did etc. for bookkeeping.
- Patient Report  
  After a patient's data is updated, their treatment summary should be sent to their relative ( can be stored on the patient model ).
