### Build a Minimum Viable Product first
Once you start building this project you will realize that it takes a long time to make real-world software. So in practice, we choose to build what is called a "minimum viable product". What is the least effort you can put in to build a useful product? This means we should limit the number of features we build and try to ship a version as soon as possible.

So instead of trying to build all the user stories one by one, you should choose a subset of features that your customer can start using from day one. In our case, it should be the bare essentials: the ability to add facilities, patients and record their information. That's it! With just this, someone can actually start using it while you implement the remaining features.

So if you build just this, you will get a passing grade for the project. Then the more features you add, the better you get at building software, and the better grades you receive.

### Build vertical slices
Okay, so you start building the project and the first feature you want to implement is the ability to add facilities. That's a good starting point. But you could spend two weeks building Facilities - make it look really nice, add the ability to upload and edit Facility Data, make reports, and so on...

But don't do that! Don't waste time making it look pretty or adding all the possible features. Just do the bare minimum for each feature, move on to the next feature, and complete a "vertical slice" as soon as possible. A vertical slice is a set of features that together provides value to the customer. Once this is done, you can do another vertical slice, and this time add a little more polish, and so on.

For example in a real-life scenario, if you're building a payment system, you could add multiple ways to receive payments: cash, credit card, bank, UPI, gift vouchers, and so on. But you should only do the fastest and most valuable thing first - cash payment. Otherwise, you can spend a whole year just building many ways to accept payment and nothing else!

Similarly in our case, you should do a "vertical slice" first - which means build the bare essentials for each feature, if we take the case of facility management, we can just have a simple form with basic styling for the first version of the application. Following this format allows you to ship features even if they are not perfect, __something is better than nothing__.

So don't spend time polishing each feature as you build it. You can always add polish later when you have shipped something.
