This milestone requires you to build tests for all the views ( Both Server-side rendered and API Based ) and ensure that the coverage is greater than 90%

The tasks created with celery should also be tested. To test a celery task, simply call the function in the test and ensure that the required functionality was handled, bounty points for testing edge cases.

## Boilerplate code

This [zip file](https://bit.ly/gdc-django-level-9) contains a boilerplate Django project along with GitHub actions that will automatically report the coverage. You can use this as a starting point for your project.

## Submission

Once all the required features are implemented, push the code to a GitHub repository and submit the link to the repo.

> When submitting the solution, ensure that you submit the whole project and not just the tests.
