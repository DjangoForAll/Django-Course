### PEP

PEP or Python Enhancement Proposal is a design document providing information to the community regarding features in Python, This is mainly intended for the folks who maintain implementations of python, to master python you can skim through the latest PEP documents and figure out what change was made and why it was made. The use of PEP is also a [PEP Document](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/)

### Formatting Python Code

Python comes with a style guide for writing code. It's called [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), It's a rigorous set of standards that are followed when writing python code, it makes it easier to share/distribute and understand Python code. 

I strongly recommend everyone to go through (even skim through) the [PEP8 Document](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

A couple of python packages also help in automatic formatting of python code, Thanks to python's extensive use of indentation, python code by default is at least partially formatted, packages like [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) help in formatting python code. Set these up with your favorite code editor to ensure that your code always stays formatted in the right way.

### PEP 20 the Zen of Python

[PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) or the Zen of python is a set of aphorisms that are considered to be the guiding principles for python's design.

> You can run `import this` in python to quickly view these aphorisms.
