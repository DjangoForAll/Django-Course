# Setting up a Development Environment

This course assumes that you've already set up a basic developer environment, which means having access to a \*NIX environment (Linux, macOS).

*nix or UN*X means Unix-like. It is an os that behaves like a UNIX system.

macOS and Linux are POSIX-compliant operating systems, although Windows is not POSIX-compliant, newer versions support WSL which aims to bring Linux like development environment to Windows, if you continue to use WSL you can choose your operating system as Linux in the installation instructions
