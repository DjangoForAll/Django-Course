### Installing Python

Throughout this course, we will be using Python 3. In many machines python defaults to python 2 and it might cause issues when you try to run sample code, make sure that you are using python 3 (preferably the latest version) always.

To install python3 on your development environment you can follow the following [article](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/)

### Code Editors

Throughout this course, I will be using visual studio code as my IDE, but you can use any other code editor. to set up vscode follow the following instructions

Visual Studio code can be downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

The python Extention is installed by default in vs code, if not install the vs code plugin for python.
