We learned the general principles of databases earlier, now we'll talk a little bit more on how to efficiently design and use databases.

Databases are usually designed before you start programming, even though frameworks like Django make it is extremely simple to create and maintain changes in the database schema, it is recommended to spend some time designing the database schema before you actually start working on the project.

Before you start developing a web application, you need to have a general idea of what you are trying to solve and what kind of data you will be handling.

Once you have a general idea, we start designing a database to store our data, ER Diagrams are usually used to visualize a database design, ER Diagram stands for Entity Relationship Diagram.

An ER Diagram simply represents different tables and how they connect to each other, it also lists out the attributes and datatypes of each table. We can take a look at our task management application's ER Diagram to quickly understand the database design.

As you can see, we only have 2 tables, one table to store our tasks and another table to store our users. A task can have only one user association, this is also known as a many to one relationship. Similarly, a user can have many tasks, this is also known as a one-to-many relationship.

There can also be one-to-one relationships, eg. when you want to store all of the user's details in a separate table, you can create a one-to-one relationship between the user and user profile tables. Because of the one-to-one relationship a given user can have only one user profile ( or none ).

The last type of relationship is a many-to-many relationship, lets say that you want to create multiple tags for each task, so one task can have many tags and tags can be connected to many tasks as well, this creates a many-to-many relationship.

Many to Many relationships cannot be created without creating a thorough table, Imagine the example we talked about earlier, Connecting multiple tasks to multiple tags, We can't have a field in the task table, since for each value of the tag we will have to duplicate the task data, Same goes with the tag table as well. This is where a through table comes in, It is a table that simply connects two tables together. Let's see an example of such a table.

As you can see, for every tag associated with a task, there needs to be another entry in the through table, no data is duplicated anywhere.

Now that we have a general idea of relationships, we can move over to the implementation.

[This Django doc](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/models/#relationships) explains each of the relationships in detail
